# Markov Text Generator

Python based text generator that uses the [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) python library.

Example data can be found in `/data/input.jsonl`. In this case, the data has been obtained from Twitter by using either [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) or [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) - All we care about is how the text corpus (body) is formatted. You're more than welcome to have a look at my [Python Twitter Scraper using Tweepy](https://github.com/timrodz/python-twitter-scraper-tweepy) for a basic implementation
